HDF5 has at least 6 mechanisms for referring to external data:


* mounted files: a HDF5 object (file, group, etc), can be temporarily mounted at a location in another HDF5 file
 - https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/H5F_MOUNT (added <= v1.2)

* external storage properties: this stores a dataset in one or more non-HDF5 files (added <= v1.2)
 - Must be stored as H5D_CONTIGUOUS (i.e. no chunking or compression can be used)
 - https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/H5P_SET_EXTERNAL
 - https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc1.6/UG/10_Datasets.html

* Virtual File Layer (VFL): specifies how the whole file is laid out on disk (added in v1.4)
 - https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Virtual+File+Drivers
 - e.g. https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/H5P_SET_FAPL_MULTI 
 
* external links: like mounting, but permanent (added in v1.8)
 - https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/H5L_CREATE_EXTERNAL
 
* Virtual Datasets (VDS): A dataset which is made up of other datasets (potentially in different files)
 - add in v1.10
 - https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Introduction+to+the+Virtual+Dataset++-+VDS
 - https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Virtual+Dataset++-+VDS
 - https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/H5P_SET_VIRTUAL
 - https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/vds.html

* Virtual Object Layer (VOL): specifies a mechanism for working with different formats/access mechanisms (added in v1.12)
