In HDF5, a \"group\" is analogous to a directory, a \"dataset\" is like a file. HDF5 also uses \"attributes\" to associate metadata with a particular group or dataset. HDF5 uses ASCII names for these different objects, and objects can be accessed by UNIX-like pathnames, e.g., \"/sample1/tempsensor/firsttrial\" for a top-level group \"sample1\", a subgroup \"tempsensor\", and a dataset \"firsttrial\".","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"For simple types (scalars, strings, and arrays), HDF5 provides sufficient metadata to know how each item is to be interpreted. For example, HDF5 encodes that a given block of bytes is to be interpreted as an array of Int64, and represents them in a way that is compatible across different computing architectures.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"However, to preserve Julia objects, one generally needs additional type information to be supplied, which is easy to provide using attributes. This is handled for you automatically in the JLD and MatIO modules for *.jld and *.mat files. These specific formats (conventions) provide \"extra\" functionality, but they are still both regular HDF5 files and are therefore compatible with any HDF5 reader or writer.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Language wrappers for HDF5 are often described as either \"low level\" or \"high level.\" This package contains both flavors: at the low level, it directly wraps HDF5's functions, thus copying their API and making them available from within Julia. At the high level, it provides a set of functions built on the low-level wrap which may make the usage of this library more convenient.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Opening-and-closing-files","page":"Home","title":"Opening and closing files","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"\"Plain\" (i.e., with no extra formatting conventions) HDF5 files are created and/or opened with the h5open command:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"fid = h5open(filename, mode)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The mode can be any one of the following:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"mode Meaning\n\"r\" read-only\n\"r+\" read-write, preserving any existing contents\n\"cw\" read-write, create file if not existing, preserve existing contents\n\"w\" read-write, destroying any existing contents (if any)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This produces an object of type HDF5File, a subtype of the abstract type DataFile.

The deflate algorithm is often more efficient if prefixed by a \"shuffle\" filter. Blosc is generally much faster than deflate – however, reading Blosc-compressed HDF5 files require Blosc to be installed. This is the case for Julia, but often not for vanilla HDF5 distributions that may be used outside Julia. (In this case, the structure of the HDF5 file is still accessible, but compressed datasets cannot be read.) Compression requires chunking, and heuristic chunking is automatically used if you specify compression but don't specify chunking.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"It is also possible to write to subsets of an on-disk HDF5 dataset.

Arrays of strings are supported using HDF5's variable-length-strings facility. By default Complex numbers are stored as compound types with r and i fields following the h5py convention. When reading data, compound types with matching field names will be loaded as the corresponding Complex julia type.
