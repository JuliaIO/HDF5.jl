# Low-level library bindings

At the lowest level, `HDF5.jl` operates by calling the public API of the HDF5 shared
library through a set of `ccall` wrapper functions.
This page documents the function names and nominal C argument types of the API which
have bindings in this package.
Note that in many cases, high-level data types are valid arguments through automatic
`ccall` conversions.
For instance, `HDF5Datatype` objects will be automatically converted to their `hid_t` ID
by Julia's `cconvert`+`unsafe_convert` `ccall` rules.

There are additional helper wrappers (often for out-argument functions) which are not
documented here.
